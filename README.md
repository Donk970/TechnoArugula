# TechnoArugula
The TechnoArugula project is a small high pressure aeroponics project built around a simple Arduino micro controller board controlling a high pressure aeroponics pump system.  The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasability of growing fresh salad greens in a DIY, controlled environment.
